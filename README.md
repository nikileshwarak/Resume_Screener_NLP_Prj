## Problem:
When companies or job platforms (like Naukri, LinkedIn, etc.) receive thousands of resumes, it's time-consuming to manually read and categorize them into job domains.

## Solution:
This project automatically predicts the category (e.g., Data Science, HR, Finance) of a resume using machine learning and NLP. It saves recruiters time and enables faster filtering, routing, and job matching.

## USE CASES:

1. Job Portals / ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems):
- Auto-categorize uploaded resumes into domains
- Improve search and matching efficiency

2. HR Tech Tools / SaaS:
- Enhance resume parsing tools with intelligent categorization
- Boost recruiter productivity

3. Recruitment Agencies:
- Automatically sort resumes by field to assign to specialized recruiters
- Career Services at Universities:
- Help categorize student resumes for placement support
